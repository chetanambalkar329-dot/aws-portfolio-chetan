## About Me
I am a fresher and currently learning cloud technologies.
My goal is to become a Cloud Engineer.

I created this portfolio to practice my skills and to showcase my learning journey.
This project is made for hands-on experience and future job opportunities.


## Hosting
This website is hosted using **GitHub Pages**.

## AWS Experience (Practice Project)

This website was first hosted using **AWS S3 static website hosting**.
I created an S3 bucket, uploaded the HTML files, and configured public access.

Later, I also deployed the same website using **GitHub Pages** for practice.
This project helped me understand basic cloud concepts like static hosting and deployment.
